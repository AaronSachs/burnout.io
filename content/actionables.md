# What can I do?
The general consensus seems to be that there are three steps in fighting
against burnout:

## 1. Determine if it's self-inflicted.
If you can take some time off, be removed from on-call for a bit, or allow that
next task to wait until you become yourself again, *do it*. Get some sleep and
figure out what it will take to remove the strain.

**Stop being a hero.** There is no benefit if the toll is so great that your 
personal life and relationships suffer.

## 2. Determine if it's an external pressure.
* Management says they need that new feature *now*. 
* You're not allowed to fix the technical debt and end up just applying 
  band-aids to everything, which means you're constantly fighting fires.
* You're the only reason the systems stay running, but you have to work 60 
  hours a week to make it happen.

If these sorts of situations sound familiar and you're burning out, it's time 
for the external factors to change.

### Communicate the burnout to people who can help. 
Yes, it's crazy, but sometimes all it takes is explaining the problem and 
talking it out with management and coworkers.

### Say "no" to unreasonable requests.
Say "no" if a request is unreasonable, but try to provide feedback in order to
prevent the pattern from continuing. 

### "Yes, and..."
If "no" doesn't work, try using the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/

and..." technique</a> in order to emphasize your willingness to work with 
the requester but also take the opportunity to establish some boundaries and 
tradeoffs. 
  
For example:

* "Yes, we'll make sure Feature X is our top priority, and to accommodate 
  the new timeline we can put Features Y and Z on hold until the next 
  release."
* "Yes, we can plan on adding Project X to our responsibilities, and we can
  take time tomorrow to plan the hiring we'll have to do in order to meet 
  that goal."

### Let it fail.
If your cries for change aren't working, allow the consequences (downtime, no
new features, etc.) to speak for themselves. If the choice is between your 
sanity and the systems you're building and maintaining, one of those needs 
to take precedence. Hint: it's your sanity! Of course, this point should be 
considered with caution (don't be malicious or reckless to prove a point).

## 3. Move on.
If the organization can't change enough to prevent burnout, leave. A recurring 
point with people who have escaped burnout seems to be "I'm so much happier now
that I work for a company that allows me to maintain a
good work-life balance."

### A note on preparation.
It's a really good idea to set aside emergency funds to use in case you have to
exercise option 3. Experiencing burnout sometimes means you need to take a 
month off before interviewing for other positions, so you need to have the
means to be able to do so.
