# What can I do?
The general consensus seems to be that there are three steps in fighting
against burnout:

## 1. Determine if it's self-inflicted.
If you can take some time off, be removed from on-call for a bit, or allow that
next task to wait until you become yourself again, *do it*. Get some sleep and
figure out what it will take to remove the strain.

The objective is to maintain a healthy work-life balance. **Stop being a hero.**
There is no benefit if the toll is so great that your personal life and 
relationships suffer.

## 2. Determine if it's an external pressure.
* Management says they need that new feature *now*. 
* You're not allowed to fix the technical debt and end up just applying 
  band-aids to everything, which means you're constantly fighting fires.
* You're the only reason the systems stay running, but you have to work 60 
  hours a week to make it happen.

If these sorts of situations sound familiar and you're burning out, it's time 
for the external factors to change.

### Find out what is causing the problem.
Burnout can be caused by mindless repetition and interruptions. Or it can be 
middle-management setting unrealistic deadlines. Document the causes, then find 
ways to alleviate them.

### Communicate the burnout to people who can help. 
Yes, it's crazy, but sometimes all it takes is explaining the problem and 
talking it out with management and coworkers. Middle-management should exist to 
help specifically with these kinds of problems.

### Say "no" to unreasonable requests.
Say "no" if a request is unreasonable, but try to provide feedback in order to
prevent the pattern from continuing. 

One sneaky way that managers turn the reasonable into the impossible is
to talk you down on your estimates, e.g., "Will it really take that long?". 
Stick by your estimates.

### "Yes, and..."
If "no" doesn't work, try using the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/
liz-orsquo/cant-say-no-say-yes-instead_b_4583052.html" target="_blank">"Yes, 
and..." technique</a> in order to emphasize your willingness to work with 
the requester but also take the opportunity to establish some boundaries and 
tradeoffs. 
  
For example:

* "Yes, we'll make sure Feature X is our top priority, and to accommodate 
  the new timeline we can put Features Y and Z on hold until the next 
  release."
* "Yes, we can plan on adding Project X to our responsibilities, and we can
  take time tomorrow to plan the hiring we'll have to do in order to meet 
  that goal."

An alternative way of phrasing "Yes, and..." is to say, "You can have everything
you want, just not all at once."

### Let it fail.
If your cries for change aren't working, allow the consequences (downtime, no
new features, etc.) to speak for themselves. If the choice is between your 
sanity and the systems you're building and maintaining, one of those needs 
to take precedence. Hint: it's your sanity! Of course, this point should be 
considered with caution (don't be malicious or reckless to prove a point).

## 3. Move on.
If the organization can't change enough to prevent burnout, leave. A recurring 
point with people who have escaped burnout seems to be "I'm so much happier now
that I work for a company that allows me to maintain a good work-life balance."
There's no guarantee, but at least you can take the opportunity to evaluate a
potential employer based on your experiences during the interview process.

### A note on preparation.
It's a really good idea to set aside emergency funds to use in case you have to
exercise option 3. Experiencing burnout sometimes means you need to take a 
month off before interviewing for other positions, so you need to have the
means to be able to do so.
