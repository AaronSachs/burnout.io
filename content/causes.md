# Figure it out.
The general consensus seems to be that there are three steps in fighting
against burnout:

## 1. Determine if it's self-inflicted.
If you can take some time off, be removed from on-call for a bit, or allow that
next task to wait until you become yourself again, *do it*. There is no benefit
to being a "hero" if the toll is so great that your personal life and
relationships suffer.

## 2. Determine if it's an external pressure.
* Management says they need that new feature *now*. 
* You're not allowed to fix the technical debt and end up just applying 
  band-aids to everything.
* You're the only reason the systems stay running, but you have to work 60 
  hours a week to make it happen.

If these sorts of situations sound familiar and you're burning out, it's time 
for the external factors to change.

### Communicate the burnout to people who can help. 
Yes, it's crazy, but sometimes all it takes is explaining the problem and 
talking it out with management and coworkers.

### Say "no" to unreasonable requests.
Say "no" if a request is unreasonable, but try to provide feedback in order to
prevent the pattern from continuing. 

If "no" doesn't work, try using the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/

and..." technique</a> in order to emphasize your willingness to work with 
the requester but also take the opportunity to establish some boundaries and 
tradeoffs. 
  
For example:

* "Yes, we'll make sure Feature X is our top priority, and to accommodate 
  the new timeline we can put Features Y and Z on hold until the next 
  release."
* "Yes, we can plan on adding Project X to our responsibilities, and we can
  take time tomorrow to plan the hiring we'll have to do in order to meet 
  that goal."

## 3. Move on.
If the organization can't change enough to prevent burnout, leave. A recurring 
point with people who have escaped burnout seems to be "I'm so much more happy
now that I work for a company that allows me to maintain a good work-life 
balance."

### A note on preparation.
It's a really good idea to set aside emergency funds to use in case you have to
exercise option 3. Experiencing burnout sometimes means you need to take a 
month off before interviewing for other positions.
