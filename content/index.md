# Burnout
Burnout is basically "the emotions a person or organization experiences that 
are associated with mental or psychological exhaustion and/or cynicism over an
extended period of time"<a href="http://www.itburnout.org/what-is-burnout/"
target="_blank">[1]</a>. 

In IT, this can manifest itself in all sorts of ways,
including stress and anxiety, loss of motivation and confidence, or even
degradation of physical health.

## Why?
This started as an Open Space discussion at the 2014 DevOpsDays 
Pittsburgh conference after hearing Jennifer Davis's talk <a href="http://new.livestream.com/devopsdaysorg/events/3044568/videos/52394934"
target="_blank">"From Hero to Zero"</a>. We shared personal stories, swore a lot, 
and eventually figured out some interesting stuff about burnout.

## What next?
The following seems to be a reasonable approach to figuring out burnout:

1. Determine if the cause is localized (self-inflicted).
2. Determine if the cause is external (management, environment, etc.) and if it
can be changed.
3. If the issue can't be fixed, it's time to find someplace new.
