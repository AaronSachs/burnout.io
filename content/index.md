# Burnout
"Burnout is a state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress."<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.helpguide.org/mental/burnout_signs_symptoms.htm">[0]</a></sup> 

In IT, this can manifest itself in all sorts of ways,
including anxiety, loss of motivation and confidence, or even
degradation of physical health.

## Summary
The following seems to be a reasonable approach to figuring out burnout:

1. Determine if the cause is localized (self-inflicted).
2. Determine if the cause is external (management, work environment issues, etc.) and if it
can be changed.
3. If the issue can't be fixed, it's time to find someplace new.

## Why?
At the 2014 DevOpsDays Pittsburgh conference, Jennifer Davis gave a talk titled, <a target="_blank" href="http://new.livestream.com/devopsdaysorg/events/3044568/videos/52394934?time=260"
