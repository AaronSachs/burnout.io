# Burnout
"Burnout is a state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress."<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.helpguide.org/mental/burnout_signs_symptoms.htm">[0]</a></sup> 

It manifests in all sorts of ways, including anxiety, loss of motivation and confidence, or even
degradation of physical health.

## Summary
The following seems to be a reasonable approach to figuring out work-related burnout:

1. Determine if the cause is localized (self-inflicted).
2. Determine if the cause is external (management, work environment issues, etc.) and if it
can be changed.
3. If the issues can't be fixed, find someplace new.

## Why?
At the 2014 DevOpsDays Pittsburgh conference, Jennifer Davis gave a talk titled, "From Hero to Zero" (<a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/104252736#t=1m4s">updated at DevOpsDays Boston 2014</a>) which sparked additional exploration of burnout during an Open Space discussion.
