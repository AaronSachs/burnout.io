## Burnout
Burnout is basically "the emotions a person or organization experiences that 
are associated with mental or psychological exhaustion and/or cynicism over an
extended period of time"<a href="http://www.itburnout.org/what-is-burnout/"
target="_blank">[1]</a>. In IT, this can manifest itself in all sorts of ways,
including stress and anxiety, loss of motivation and/or confidence, or even
degradation of physical health.

## Why?
This started as an open space discussion at the 2014 DevOpsDays 
Pittsburgh conference. We shared personal stories, swore a lot, and eventually
figured out some interesting stuff about burnout and how to mitigate its
effects.

## Answers
We have no idea if this is the best way to address the issue, but our general 
consensus indicated the following to be a reasonable approach to burnout:

1. Determine if the cause is localized (self-inflicted).
2. Determine if the cause is external (management, environment, etc.) and if it
can be changed.
3. If the issue can't be fixed, it's time to find someplace new.

## 1. Self-inflicted
If you can take some time off, be removed from on-call for a bit, or allow that
next task to wait until you become yourself again, *do it*. There is no benefit
to being a "hero" if the toll is so great that your personal life and
relationships suffer.

## 2. External pressures
* Management says they need that new feature *now*. 
* You're not allowed to fix the technical debt and end up just applying band-aids to everything.
* You're the only reason the systems stay running. 

If this sounds familiar and you're burning out, it's time for the external factors to change.

1. Communicate the need to people who can help. Yes, it's crazy, but sometimes
all it takes is explaining the problem and talking it out with management and
other coworkers.
2. Say "No" to unreasonable requests, but try to provide feedback in order to
prevent continued patterns of unreasonable requests. Also consider using the "Yes, and..." technique
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/liz-orsquo/cant-say-no-say-yes-instead_b_4583052.html"
target="_blank">[2]</a> in order to emphasize your willingness but also take
the opportunity to establish some boundaries and tradeoffs. For example:
  * "Yes, I can deploy that on Saturday, and I'll just make the adjustment on the 
invoice to the off-hours rate."
  * "Yes, we'll make sure Feature X is our top priority, and to accommodate the
new timeline we can put Features Y and Z on hold until the next release."
  * "Yes, we can plan on adding Project X to our responsibilities, and we can
take time tomorrow to discuss the hiring we'll have to do in order to meet that
goal."

In the worst case, if you are a valuable resource to the company, you can 
certainly be doing the same kinds of work for another company somewhere else.

## 3. Get out of Dodge
If the organization can't change enough to prevent burnout, leave. A recurring 
point was "I'm so much more happy now that I work for Company X."
