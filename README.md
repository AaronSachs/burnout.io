## Roadmap

### Hosting
Burnout.io will likely be moving to GitHub pages in the near future, per [#6](https://github.com/bemosior/burnout.io/issues/6). The change would help achieve a sustainable hosting model and decentralize control so that potentially anyone could maintain the site.

### Model
Static content can only so helpful. We'd like to begin featuring articles on burnout and IT health so burnout.io can be a helpful resource for information in the long-term.

### reignite.io
[burnout.io](http://burnout.io) will be integrating with and featuring content from [reignite.io](http://reignite.io), "a place where we as technologists can share our stories, frustrations, successes, etc in regards to burnout."<sup>[[1]](http://reignite.nodebb.com/topic/1/welcome-friends#1)</sup>

More to come.
